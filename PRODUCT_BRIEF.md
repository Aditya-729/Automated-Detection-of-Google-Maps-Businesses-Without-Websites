### The Duplicable PRD
Create a project document by sending the following prompts to your vibe coding tool:

---

> Please generate a **standard developer documentation example** for the **Mino API use case** I’ve developed.
> 
> 1. **Product Architecture Overview**
>     - Describe the overall system architecture in simple terms
>     - Explain which APIs are being called
>     - Clarify the relationship between each API
>     - Specify how many times each API is called
>     - Explain how these API calls are orchestrated and connected together
> 2. **Code Snippet**
>     - Provide a runnable example in a relevant tech stack (cURL, TypeScript, or Python)
>     - Show how the Mino API is invoked within the flow
> 3. **Goal (Prompt)**
>     - Include the exact natural language prompt sent to the Mino API
>     - Clearly format and label this prompt so readers understand the intent
> 4. **Sample Output**
>     - Provide a simulated streaming JSON response returned by the Mino API
